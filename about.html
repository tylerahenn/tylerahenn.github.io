        <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Tyler Henn and I am a senior at <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/" target="_blank">Kennesaw State University</a>. I am an <a href="https://chss.kennesaw.edu/tcid/programs/bsid.php" target="_blank">Interaction Design</a> major
    with a <a href="https://chss.kennesaw.edu/tcid/programs/tcomminor.php" target="_blank">Technical Communication minor</a>.</p>

  <p>My passion for collaboration initially attracted me to this major. I have always enjoyed working with others because
  I believe that multiple people can bring interesting points of view to the table. Taking matters into my own hands when
  it came to the design of products also interested me. This major seemed perfect because I would be able to express my own ideas while also listening to others,
  and end up with a product that has been touched by many hands.</p>

  <p>As I have progressed through my major, I have become particularly fond of usability testing and interactive design.
  I enjoy getting feedback on my team's work from. It is a great way to better understand how people interact with your product. From feedback, I am able to go back to the drawing
  board with my team to iterate the design and improve the user experience. I also enjoy designing the way in which a user interacts with a product rather than just making it look nice.</p>

  <p>The project that I have worked on that I am the proudest of is an app called <a href="muse.html">Muse</a> that our team created in our senior portfolio class. I collaborated with three teammates to create Muse,
  an app that we designed to help songwriters overcome writer's block. Using Goal-Directed Design methods, we conducted user research, created a prototype, conducted user testing, and then
  iterated our design based on the feedback we received. Our entire team was very passionate about music, so this project was extremely fun to work on. Even though this prototype requires a
  lot of work, we were able to keep the work environment very positive and lighthearted. We had the opportunity to conduct interviews with musicians and use their feedback to help us create
  our prototype. This was a very rewarding project, and it was by far the most fun I have had working with a team.</p>
