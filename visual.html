      <h1>Visual Design Project</h1>
      <p>This is a visual design study that I created with the goal of implementing different design concepts to portray a specific feeling in the design.</p>
      <p>For this design, the feelings that I wanted to portray were <strong>calm</strong> and <strong>friendly</strong>.</p>
      <p>On this page, I will go through the design decisions that I made, and I will explain why I made them</p>

    <div class="defaultTextFormat">
      <h2>Tagline</h2>
      <p>For this tagline of this lockup, I chose "Think Less. Experience More". The "Think Less" was inspired by
        Steve Krug's book, <a href="https://sensible.com/dont-make-me-think/">"Don't Make Me Think"</a>. I beleive that this tagline perfectly describes my design philosophy.
        I want to design my products so that users don't have to think about how a feature works, or if an element is clickable. I also want them to be able to experience more
        on one of my products than they were previously able to while using a different product.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="defaultTextFormat">
      <h2>Color Choices</h2>
      <p>Starting off, I chose colors that would effectively convey a calm and friendly feeling to users. Since low-key colors tend to give more of a
        serious and professional feeling in design, I chose to use high-key colors which give a more calm and friendly feeling. I also chose to use
        cool colors, which move backward in a design, because I did not want for my lockup (the entire logo) to be too aggressive or flashy. Warm
        colors tend to come forward in this way. I also chose to use analogous colors because they give a more natural and calm effect, whereas
        complementary colors feel more artificial and striking.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="defaultTextFormat">
      <h2>Typeface</h2>
      <p>Next, I had to find a typeface that would give a calm and friendly feeling while also feeling clean and modern. For my typeface,
        I used sans serif because it is more modern and approachable. Serif typefaces tend to come off as more traditional, and I see my brand
        identity as more modern and clean. The typeface that I chose uses both curved lines and horizontal lines. Curved lines convey a relaxed
        feeling, and horizontal lines create a calm and tranquil feeling. Diagonal lines create a more dramatic feel, and vertical lines create
        a more stable feel which was not exactly the feeling that I wanted to convey.</p>
        <h2>Sans Serif Font</h2>
        <p class="center">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</p>
        <p class="center">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p>
    </div>

    <div class="defaultTextFormat">
      <h2>Shapes</h2>
      <p>The typeface that I chose uses both curved lines and horizontal lines. Curved lines convey a relaxed feeling, and horizontal lines create
        a calm and tranquil feeling. Diagonal lines create a more dramatic feel, and vertical lines create a more stable feel which was not exactly
        the feeling that I wanted to convey. I went with horizontal and curved lines in my lockup because I wanted to convey a calm and friendly feeling
        while also having a modern and clean design. My entire lockup also has a horizontal feel because the tagline (the slogan below the logo) stretches
        beyond the logotype (the TH on top that can be used separately from the tagline).</p>
      </div>

    <div class="defaultTextFormat">
      <h2>Closing</h2>
      <p>Between my color choices, the font I chose to use, and the different shapes within my lockup, I beleive that I have successfully created a lockup
        that conveys a calm and friendly feeling to users. I enjoyed this study, because it allowed for me to set particular guidelines before starting, and
        then implement my knowledge of different elements of design to work with in those guidelines. I am excited to continue to implement my knowledge of 
        design concepts in the future.</p>
