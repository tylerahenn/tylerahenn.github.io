    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>QuickFlicks is a kiosk created with the goal of shortening wait times
      for tickets and concessions at movie theaters. It is designed to improve
      the purchasing experience by combining both tickets and concessions into
      one purchase.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="introRight">
    <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>I took the role of head researcher for this project. I gathered data
        from user testing sessions that were then applied to our prototype.
        I also took charge of product name generation, logo concepts, and
        various visual improvements to the prototype. </p>

<div class="lean">
  <h2>Lean UX</h2>
    <p>We used Lean UX methods to create QuickFlicks. Lean UX is a method of design
that starts with making assumptions about what users will want from a product
and making changes as you go based off of feedback from testing users. The
design process is broken into sprints (periods of design, user testing, and
prototyping that can be repeated as many times as necessary). We went through
2 sprints for this project.</p>
</div>

<div class="sprint1design0">
  <h2>Sprint 1 - Design 0</h2>
    <p>Our team used Lean UX methods to design QuickFlicks. We started our design
      process by making assumptions about what users would want from QuickFlicks and
      affinity mapping our thoughts on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who would use this kiosk?</li>
        <li>What might the business outcomes be?</li>
        <li>What might the user outcomes be?</li>
        <li>What features might be included?</li>
      </ul>
</div>
<div class="fourPics">
  <ul>
    <li><img src="QFIMG\Potential_Users.jpg" alt="Our initial brainstorm for what kind of users we thought might be attracted to our product" width="150" height="auto"></li>
    <li><img src="QFIMG\Business_Outcomes.jpg" alt="Our initial brainstorm for what we thought our business outcomes would be" width="150" height="auto"></li>
    <li><img src="QFIMG\User_Outcomes.jpg" alt="Our initial brainstorm for what we thought our users' outcomes would be" width="150" height="auto"></li>
    <li><img src="QFIMG\Potential_Features.jpg" alt="Our initial brainstorm for what features we thought would be included in our product" width="150" height="auto"></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="sprint1design0">
  <p>We also used this time to create a hypothesis table which essentially turned these
    ideas into statements about how features would benefit both us and users, and a product
    backlog which would contain all the features we thought we would add over the course of
    our time with this kiosk.</p>
</div>

<div class="personas">
  <h2>Personas</h2>
  <p>Once we found thoughts that we shared on what the kiosk could provide for users and businesses,
    we created various personas that may use QuickFlicks to purchase tickets and concessions at a
    movie theater.</p>
</div>
    <div class="threePics">
      <ul>
        <li><img src="QFIMG\Persona_Chad.png" alt="Our first persona, Chad. He is a 20 year old extroverted college student with lots of friends." width="200px" height="auto"></li>
        <li><img src="QFIMG\Persona_Elizabeth.png" alt="Our second persona, Elizabeth. She is a 23 year old introverted bookstore worker who always carries cash." width="200px" height="auto"></li>
        <li><img src="QFIMG\Persona_John.png" alt="Our third persona, John. He is a 42 year old father of two who only wants to make one purchase at a movie theater." width="200px" height="auto"></li>
      </ul>  
    </div>


    <h2>Paper Prototyping</h2>
      <p>At this point, we each grabbed a stack of paper and sketched out our ideas for each page individually.
        We then compared our ideas and decided which ideas would be the best for each page, and sketched up another
        paper prototype which combined all of these ideas.</p>
          <img src="" alt="">

    <h2>Sprint 1 - Week 1</h2>
      <p>Once we finished sketching up our paper prototype, we were ready for some user testing to generate feedback on
         our ideas. We found 3 random participants in the library. We asked each participant 10 questions about their past
         experiences with movie theaters, and their preferences for purchasing tickets and concessions. The feedback was
         mostly positive and confirmed that we were headed in the right direction.</p>
         <img src="" alt="">

    <h2>Low Fidelity Digital Prototyping</h2>
      <p>After testing users with the paper prototype, we received positive feedback about our ideas for the kiosk. We
        moved on to a low fidelity digital prototype in Figma. We decided on a main path that we could test users on and
        built it, essentially creating a minimum viable product.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>With this low fidelity prototype, users could select a movie, choose how many tickets they need, add a concessions
          item, and view their cart on the checkout page. They could then pay with card or cash, and decide if they want a receipt.</p>

    <h2>Sprint 1 - Week 2</h2>
      <p>Now that we had a good path laid down for how the kiosk would flow, it was time to start adding some more content from our product
        backlog that would be necessary for a positive experience with the kiosk. We added:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A cart in top right corner that reflects when something is added to cart</li>
          <li>Our logo to the opening and closing pages</li>
          <li>QuickPacks (predetermined concessions deals) and added a section for them in concessions</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Sprint 2 - Design 0</h2>
      <p>To start off our second design sprint, we assessed our progress with the design of QuickFlicks, and reviewed our hypothesis table and product backlog.<br>

We ended up removing a hypothesis regarding adding healthy options to the concessions. While we thought that this would be an important feature to provide for health conscious customers, user testing indicated that users had no interest in such a feature at a movie theater.<br>

At this point, we decided what features we wanted to add to the kiosk during this sprint:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Membership rewards</li>
  <li>Added many features to the checkout page</li>
  <li>Visual Improvements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Improvements</h2>
  <p>In our first week, we made many visual improvement to the kiosk:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gradients</li>
    <li>Drop Shadows</li>
    <li>Strokes around buttons</li>
    <li>Rounded off corners</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before and after pictures are on display below.</p>

  <h2>Sprint 2 - Week 1</h2>
    <p>After we made visual improvements to the kiosk, we took the 2nd week to
      conduct more user testing. We used the same approach to user testing that we
      used in Sprint 1. Feedback regarding our visual improvements was positive as a whole. </p>
      <img src="" alt="">
    <p>We received some negative feedback on the process of adding an item to the cart. In our first sprint
      we added a shopping cart to the header of the kiosk with a number that would go up when users add an item to their cart.
      We found that this wasnâ€™t enough for all users to understand that the item had been added. We implemented this modal window
      to further confirm when something is added to the cart.</p>
      <img src="" alt="">
    <p>Another change that we made based off of user feedback was to the drink selection menu when you add a QuickPack. Originally
      it was very small, and users had to scroll to see all the options. In addition, when users selected a drink, the confirm button
      would block part of the window. </p>
      <img src="" alt="">
    <p>After we found that users were not a fan of the small window, we enlarged it so that no scrolling was required to select a drink,
      and the confirm button was not in the way of any drinks.</p>
      <img src="" alt="">

  <h2>Sprint 2 - Week 2</h2>
      <p>During week 2, the checkout page underwent a massive update. We made some visual improvements, and we also added:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discount Page</li>
        <li>Membership page</li>
        <li>Back to Concessions button</li>
        <li>Cancel Order button</li>
        <li>The ability to remove an item from the cart</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The membership page allows users to redeem rewards if they have a QuickFlicks membership by signing in on the kiosk or
        scanning your QR code. Users can receive a discount once the kiosk attendant checks their ID and approves of it.</p>

    <h2>Closing</h2>
      <p>Working on this project was nothing short of a pleasure. This was my introduction to Lean UX methods, and I can confidently say
        that this project improved my design skills and knowledge. I enjoyed the frequent user feedback and dynamically improving the prototype.
        I hope to use Lean UX methods again in the future. I'm proud of what our team produced, and I look forward to working on more projects
        in the future.</p>
